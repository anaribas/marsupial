RGrade is a very useful companion of Marsupial, freely available on: https://github.com/imartel/Rgrade. It's a different project, not part of Marsupial. The file "rgrade_xxx.zip" is just a snapshot of the existing code in Rgrade repository, included here for convenience.

RGrade was created by Text-La Galera (http://www.text-lagalera.cat) to simplify and make more usable the Moodle Gradebook when dealing with digital textbooks in Remote Content.
